This is a derived work of Stefano Zacchiroli from www.vim.org who created the vimCU script for
comment the code in Vim.

The original code is clean and full of comments. Thanks for the job done.

I found that it's not enough from my daily work. I used the Nerd Comment before. But it is not work
well under certain lanauage. Like lua and matlab. So, I try to find others to replace. I tested several comment plugins from www.vim.org. Some is imcomprehensive or too complex for me to understand.
At last I find vimCU.

I added several enhancements:
Block mode to comment/uncoment.
Autodetect filetype to determine what comment mark to use.
Use multi line mode instead of single line.

Any further enhancement or suggestions are welcomed!.
