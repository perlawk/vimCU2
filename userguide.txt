Faq:
Ask:
How to add a language that is not supported yet in VimCU2.
Ans:

1.
Add filetype in .vim/ftdetect as:
cat mylang.vim
au BufREad,BufNewFile *.myextension set filetype=mylang

2.
Add/modify VimCU2.vim in .vim/plugin/vimCU2.vim
let g:CommentStyleMyLanguage=[ "mylang" ]

in function SetCommentMarks():
add:
elseif ... 
as example from the other language.

in function GetCommentSylte()
also add:
elseif ... 
as example from the other language.

Ask:
Why so crumsy to add a language?
Ans:
Any good solution/suggestions is welcome!
